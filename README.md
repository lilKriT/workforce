Created by lilKriT.

# Brief

Workforce is a web based game about hard workers. You start out as a single person, with basic tools. For your work you get paid, and you can spend money on upgrades, consumables, hiring new workers and branching out.

# Details

In the middle of the screen you have your current task (a rock to break, tree to chop down...). The task has some EP (effort points, same as HP). After finishing the task, you get some resources which you can sell for money. Then you get another task.

Possible tasks:

- soft rock
- medium rock
- hard rock

Possible upgrades:

- basic pick
- advanced pick
- drill

Possible skills:

- normal hit
- strong hit (uses stamina, deals way more damage)
- precise hit (uses stamina, has huge chance to crit, has cooldown?)
- miner song (has cooldown and duration, increases all stats)

Possible coworkers:

Some upgrades will be local to the task type (lumberjack, miner) and some will be global (backpack, faster transport, food truck)

Possible consumables:

- sandwich (restores stamina)
- energy drink (temporary strength buff)

In the bottom of the screen you see a list of following tasks.

Current idea, might be changed later:

- you can only buy stuff in the shop (you need to click a few times to travel to the shop)
- you can only buy food in another shop (again, a few clicks)
